I have finally finished my first project.  It seemed like such a daunting task in the beginning and I didn't know where to start.  I got so used to coding in the structure of the labs with more guidance and specs that explicitly told me what to do next, so I was intimidated by the concept of creating a gem on my own. Thankfully, Avi did a great walkthrough example, which helped me get started.

First task: What should I scrape? 

I recently went on a vacation to Napa Valley, CA and instantly knew the topic for my application: WINE! I thought of all of the websites I wanted to scrape like vivino.com, totalwine.com, etc. However, I quickly learned that all sites are not created equal. Some websites block scrapers and some have Javascript that prohibits you from getting the desired information, like Vivino (ps: for all of the wine lovers out there, I strongly suggest checking out Vivino - you won't be disappointed). Thankfully, totalwine.com seemed like it met the qualifications for scraping.

As a wine lover, I'm always on the lookout for good wine, so I created an application that scrapes the top 20 wines of 2017 as ranked by totalwine.com. 

I jumped in and created a gem and set up the required structure. Once I got my environment straight (which was harder than I anticipated) and found the right website, the rest went smoothly and quickly.

Overall, I feel significantly more confident in my Ruby abilities. I can definitely see myself expanding this app into a more robust wine repository in the future.
