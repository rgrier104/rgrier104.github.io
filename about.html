<p>Full stack software engineer with a passion for solving complex problems through code. Experienced in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and React as well as 5+ years professional experience in data analytics and technical consulting. I discovered software development by using statistical programs to solve problems and through my experience working for a hyper-growth SaaS technology company. I bring strong skills in problem-solving, communication, and teamwork that help organizations drive growth and meet goals through technical solutions. When Iâ€™m not coding, I love exploring the Hawaiian outdoors.</p>
